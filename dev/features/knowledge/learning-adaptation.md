# Learning & Adaptation

## Overview
Intelligent systems that learn from usage patterns and adapt to user behavior.

## Pattern Recognition
- **Usage Patterns**: Identify common user behaviors
- **Definition Patterns**: Recognize recurring structures
- **Error Patterns**: Learn from common mistakes
- **Success Patterns**: Identify effective approaches

## Suggestion System
- **Predictive Definitions**: Suggest likely predicates
- **Completion Assistance**: Auto-complete based on context
- **Relationship Suggestions**: Propose connections
- **Optimization Hints**: Recommend improvements

## Auto-completion and Prediction
- **Context-Aware Completion**: Relevant suggestions
- **Probabilistic Ranking**: Most likely completions first
- **Learning from Feedback**: Improve over time
- **Personalization**: Adapt to individual users

## Error Learning and Prevention
- **Common Error Detection**: Identify typical mistakes
- **Preventive Warnings**: Alert before errors occur
- **Correction Suggestions**: Propose fixes
- **Learning from Corrections**: Improve future suggestions

## Adaptive Interface
- **Personalized UI**: Adapt to user preferences
- **Skill-Based Features**: Show appropriate complexity
- **Workflow Optimization**: Streamline common tasks
- **Accessibility**: Adapt to different abilities

## Usage Examples
```
# Pattern recognition
socrates% analyze-patterns
>> Common pattern detected: "x is-human -> x is-mortal"
>> Suggestion: Create template for mortality concepts

# Suggestion system
socrates% term: "aristotle"
>> Suggestion: Based on context, might be:
>>   1. aristotle is-human (confidence: 95%)
>>   2. aristotle is-philosopher (confidence: 87%)
>>   3. aristotle is-student-of(teacher=plato) (confidence: 75%)

# Error learning
socrates% predicate: "is-immortal"(x)
>> Warning: This contradicts existing "is-mortal" definitions
>> Common error: Confusing logical negation with contradictions
>> Suggestion: Consider "not-mortal" or "has-unknown-mortality"

# Adaptive interface
socrates% set-skill-level advanced
>> Enabled: advanced logical operators, meta-predicates
>> Disabled: basic tutorials, simple mode warnings
```

## Priority: Low
Enhances user experience but not critical for core functionality.
