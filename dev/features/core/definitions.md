# Definitional Constructs

## Overview
Advanced mechanisms for defining terms and predicates in Socratesian.

## Recursive Definitions
- **Self-Reference**: Predicates that reference themselves
- **Base Cases**: Terminating conditions for recursion
- **Inductive Definitions**: Building complex concepts from simpler ones
- **Mutual Recursion**: Multiple predicates defining each other

## Conditional Definitions
- **Context-Dependent**: Meanings that change based on context
- **Parameterized Definitions**: Definitions with variable parameters
- **Default Cases**: Fallback definitions when conditions aren't met
- **Override Mechanisms**: Specialized definitions for specific cases

## Layered Definitions
- **Abstraction Levels**: Multiple layers of detail
- **Progressive Refinement**: Adding detail incrementally
- **View-Dependent**: Different definitions for different purposes
- **Inheritance Hierarchies**: Parent-child definition relationships

## Partial Definitions
- **Incomplete Specifications**: Useful but not fully defined
- **Gradual Completion**: Adding details over time
- **Placeholder Predicates**: Temporary definitions
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Definitions with unknown aspects

## Definition Types
- **Explicit**: Direct specification of meaning
- **Implicit**: Meaning derived from usage
- **Operational**: Defined by procedures or algorithms
- **Axiomatic**: Defined by properties and relationships

## Usage Examples
```
# Recursive definition
ancestor(x, y) := parent(x, y) || (some z)(parent(x, z) && ancestor(z, y))

# Conditional definition
temperature-feeling(x, temp) := 
  if temp < 0 then "freezing"
  else if temp < 20 then "cold"
  else if temp < 30 then "warm"
  else "hot"

# Layered definition (abstract level)
vehicle(x) := can-transport(x)

# Layered definition (concrete level)
vehicle(x) := has-wheels(x) && has-engine(x) && can-carry-passengers(x)

# Partial definition
consciousness(x) := has-awareness(x) && [UNDEFINED: neural-correlates]
```

## Priority: High
Essential for building complex knowledge structures and handling real-world ambiguity.
