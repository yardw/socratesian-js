# Socratesian Logic Parser - Feature Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains hierarchical documentation for all planned features of the Socratesian logic parser system.

## Directory Structure

### Core Language Features (`core/`)
Essential language constructs and logical foundations:
- **[Logical Operators](core/logical-operators.md)** - Basic logical operators, quantifiers, modal and temporal logic
- **[Type System](core/type-system.md)** - Primitive types, complex types, constraints, and polymorphism
- **[Quantification](core/quantification.md)** - Advanced quantification beyond basic universal/existential
- **[Definitions](core/definitions.md)** - Recursive, conditional, layered, and partial definitions

### Parser/Interpreter Features (`parser/`)
User interaction and system intelligence:
- **[Input Processing](parser/input-processing.md)** - Natural language parsing and ambiguity resolution
- **[Interactive Features](parser/interactive-features.md)** - Undo/redo, session management, validation
- **[Reasoning Engine](parser/reasoning-engine.md)** - Inference, consistency checking, theorem proving
- **[Visualization](parser/visualization.md)** - Export formats, mind maps, proof visualization

### Knowledge Management (`knowledge/`)
Systems for organizing and maintaining knowledge:
- **[Knowledge Base](knowledge/knowledge-base.md)** - Persistence, modularity, version control
- **[Collaboration](knowledge/collaboration.md)** - Shared definitions, peer review, conflict resolution
- **[Learning & Adaptation](knowledge/learning-adaptation.md)** - Pattern recognition, suggestions, error learning

### Advanced Features (`advanced/`)
Sophisticated capabilities for expert users:
- **[Meta-Logic](advanced/meta-logic.md)** - Self-reference, meta-predicates, system introspection
- **[Domain Extensions](advanced/domain-extensions.md)** - Mathematical, philosophical, scientific, legal logic
- **[Performance & Integration](advanced/performance-integration.md)** - Optimization, scalability, external integration
