# Performance & Integration Features

## Overview
System optimization and external integration capabilities.

## Performance Optimization
- **Incremental Parsing**: Process large texts efficiently
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded reasoning
- **Caching Systems**: Store computed results
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Efficient memory usage
- **Query Optimization**: Fast search and retrieval

## Scalability Features
- **Distributed Processing**: Scale across multiple machines
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute computational load
- **Memory Management**: Handle large knowledge bases
- **Streaming Processing**: Handle continuous input
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Compute only when needed

## External Integration
- **API Development**: Programmatic access to parser
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality
- **External Tools**: Connect to theorem provers
- **Data Import/Export**: Interface with other systems
- **Web Services**: Cloud-based deployment

## Database Integration
- **Relational Databases**: SQL-based storage
- **NoSQL Databases**: Document and graph storage
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Semantic web integration
- **Vector Databases**: Similarity search
- **Distributed Storage**: Fault-tolerant storage

## Monitoring and Analytics
- **Performance Metrics**: Track system performance
- **Usage Analytics**: Understand user behavior
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor and fix issues
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Audit Logging**: Track all system changes

## Usage Examples
```
# Performance optimization
socrates% enable-caching
>> Caching enabled for frequently accessed definitions
>> Cache hit rate: 85%

# API integration
curl -X POST /api/v1/parse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Socrates is mortal"}'

# Plugin system
socrates% load-plugin mathematics-extended
>> Loaded 47 mathematical predicates
>> Loaded 12 proof strategies

# Monitoring
socrates% performance-report
>> Average query time: 0.03s
>> Memory usage: 245MB
>> Knowledge base size: 10,000 terms
>> Uptime: 7 days, 14 hours

# External tool integration
socrates% connect-prover z3
>> Connected to Z3 theorem prover
>> Available strategies: SAT, SMT, QBF
```

## Priority: Low
Important for production systems but not needed for initial development.
